# Projects

Here are some of my projects:

1.AlgoritmiGenetici/Genetici P Final - is a small c ++ application built in visual studio, which uses genetic algorithms to simulate the reproduction of individuals and the evolution and mutation of genes.
The simulation is done by generating a population of individuals with random genes. A new population will be created, by passing the initial population through
the phases of selection of individuals, crossing and mutation of genes. After these phases the new population becomes the old one, 
and the proces repeats until the individuals gets to the best genetic condition.

2.Licenta - is a Web application, created to optimize and facilitate the warranty management process, 
both for the beneficiary of the guarantee and for the members of the service that will deal with the product under warranty.
The application can be divided into 3 modules: Customer module, Service members/Admins module and Superadmin module.
Technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL.

The file contains a GET php method and also a POST php method.

4.Sudoku - is a c++ application built in visual studio, that solves sudoku games, using recursive functions.

5.Tcpdf - is a php web application, that uses tcpdf library. The purpose of the program is to help the computer science students to complete quickly and easily the forms for the summer practice.
